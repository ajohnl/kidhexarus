# kidhexarus

Converts your desired stars and mods into a string of hex code you can paste behind your weapon ID when editing weapons, also useful for finding weapons in your save files, simply input the mods of the weapon and paste the output in you hex editor's search tool.





Most of the inputs have to be abreviations, such as dcs+1, scs+3, ipab-3. Mods that only have one word in them must be written as they are (except for paralysis and petrification, para and petri, respectively. The input must be one word, no spaces between the +/- and the mod/number.




Some rather exceptional mods:
Paralysis:para
Petrification:petri
Walking Speed:ws
Running Speed:rs
Status resistance:stat
